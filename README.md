# Malware-Repository

Malware Repository is a project that will allow the uploading of malware samples as well as allow for analysis of malware. The repository will assist in the determining if a computer system is infested with malware

### Abstract
Computers systems, networks and mobile devices are prone to infection by malicious software, which pose a threat to data, information and operations of individual computing devices as well as networked computers in an enterprise. Malicious code is an increasingly important problem that threatens the security of computer systems. The Traditional line of defence against malware is composed of malware detectors such as virus and spyware scanners. Computer Security is a major concern and many at times, the computing and networking devices may not work as expected. This may be as a result of malware or a hardware issue. Differentiating the two may be quite hard, with computers flogged with free anti-malware software that may not detect Malware presence. There arises a need to study malware, to understand how they replicate and how, when and what payload they execute in order to cause damage. This understanding helps in the development of anti-malware software. This study aims to develop and evaluate malware troubleshooting and research repository.
This study will use exploratory research technique since the research explores and attempts to test the prototype developed. The research design will focus on collecting data from a sampled population, using purposive sampling technique. The focus groups in this study will consist of researchers in Malware, security analysts, network administrators, IT administrators, computer users and computer maintainers.
The prototype will be designed using an Entity Relationship Diagram and a Data Flow Diagram, developed using wire frame sketcher, android studio, bootstrap 4 framework and Laravel PHP framework and tested for functionality.
